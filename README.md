## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Luce and I am an Undergraduate student at the University of Illinois in Chicago where I am working towards a bachelor's Degree in Computer Science

-   **Coding languages:** C++, Java, Python, SQL, Prolog, Javascript, Lua  
-   **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, pyodbc  
-   **Developer tools:** Git, VS Code, Node.js, Google test (gtest), Notepad++  
-   **Knowledgable in:** SDLC, Google Suite, Unity  

I have a long history with gaming in general as my family was very engrossed in gaming with consoles such as the SNES, N64, and the original PlayStation. Naturally, I gravitated toward that and as I grew up I developed a passion for playing games and as I got my first pc and learned about Steam I was locked in. This passion drove me to learn more about computers since I spent a lot of my time on them which pushed me to learn about coding and how to develop programs of my preference. This led me to pursue computer science as my major at the University of Illinois in Chicago 

As I approach my later college years, I seek to develop my skills further by studying various development tools and programming languages as well as working on and improving some of my projects. I hope to provide all the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout my academic years to an internship whether it be for Game development or Software engineering.


Currently working on:  
-  FridgeStocker - keeps track of what is in my fridge and gives recipes for the ingredients inside
-  A personal production app - that keeps me focus and on task as I do schoolwork

Some of the past projects I have worked on include:  
- Worked on a Discord Bot with friends and experimented with the Discord api to add fun features such as a currency system
- Worked in the game development team for the fall 2023 semester in the ISU Game dev club  
- Mods for some of my favorite games, which include Project Zomboid, Civilization 6
