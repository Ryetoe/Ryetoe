## Hi there 👋

I'm Joshua Luce, an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois in Chicago, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science!

### 🛠 Skills:
-   **Coding languages:** C++, Java, Python, SQL, Prolog, Javascript, Lua  
-   **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, pyodbc  
-   **Developer tools:** Git, VS Code, Node.js, Google test (gtest), Notepad++  
-   **Knowledgeable in:** Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Google Suite, Unity  

### 🎮 My Story:
I have a long history with gaming in general as my family was very engrossed in gaming with consoles such as the SNES, N64, and the original PlayStation. Naturally, I gravitated toward that and as I grew up I developed a passion for playing games, and as I got my first PC, I learned about Steam and developed a massive interest in how video games were developed, by then I was locked in. This passion fueled my interest in computers and coding, leading me to develop programs tailored to my preferences. 

While my focus has broadened beyond gaming, it has remained a driving force behind my curiosity for new languages and development tools which has now led me to pursue computer science as my major at the University of Illinois in Chicago. At UIC I hope to further expand my knowledge in programming languages and work on bigger projects with different people. 


### 💼 Career Goals:
As I approach my final college years, I aim to deepen my skills by exploring new development tools, programming languages, and personal projects. I'm eager to apply my growing skill set in a software engineering or game development internship. I'm always open to learning and excited about the possibilities the future holds in the tech and gaming industries.


### 🚧 Current projects:
-  FridgeStocker - keeps track of what is in my fridge and gives recipes for the ingredients inside
-  A personal production app - that keeps me focused and on task as I do schoolwork

### 🏗️ Past projects:
- Worked on a Discord Bot with friends and experimented with the Discord api to add fun features such as a currency system
- Worked in the game development team for the fall 2023 semester in the ISU Game dev club  
- Additionally, I’ve worked on mods for games like Project Zomboid and Civilization 6, exploring ways to enhance player experiences.
