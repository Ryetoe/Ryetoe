## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Luce and I am an Undergraduate student at the University of Illinois in Chicago where I am working towards a bachelor's Degree in Computer Science

I have a long history with gaming in general as my family was very engrossed in gaming in the past with consoles such as the SNES, N64, and the original PlayStation. Naturally, I gravitated toward that and as I grew up I developed a passion for playing games and as I got my first pc and learned about Steam I was locked in. This passion drove me to learn more about computers since I spent a lot of my time on them which pushed me to learn about coding and how to develop programs of my own personal preference. This led me to pursue computer science as my major in the University of Illinois in Chicago 


Currently working on:

Worked on a Discord Bot with friends and experimented with the Discord api to add fun features

Proficient Languages: C++, Python, C, Java
